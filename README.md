# modded-t480

small project to buy a used laptop and upgrade it. choosed the Lenovo ThinkPad T480 due to it's claimed build quality, upgradablilty, and perforamnce despite its age: considered one of the last great laptops and was currently available for me at a good price

will try and run the machine with a dual os, linux mint & windows 10 LTSC
