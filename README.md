# modded-t480

small project to buy a used laptop and upgrade it. chose the Lenovo ThinkPad T480 due to it's claimed build quality, upgradablilty, and perforamnce despite its age: considered one of the last great laptops. had a good deal for one nearby as well

will try and run the machine with a dual os, linux mint & windows 10 LTSC
